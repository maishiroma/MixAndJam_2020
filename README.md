Welcome to my second game jam entry! This time, it is for the game jam, Mix and Jam 2020! The theme of the year was
__mixing genres__, so I thought why not do something a little more...interesting? Behold, __Blocker Blunders__! (Totally did not come up with that name in 5 mins).

This is a platformer, puzzle game where you are in control of a little wizard guy. This person has to make their way through a giant forest, but unfortunatly, his little legs can't exactly allow him to make some easy jumps. Thus, he decided to enlist in his block dropping powers to help him along!

By using his powers, he can make any gap look traversable! Can you use this ability to make it out of the forest?

## Game Summary
__Blocker Blunders__ is a platformer puzzle game where the player needs to guide their avatar across three challenging levels! To succeed, the player not only must master the art of jumping, but also rack their brain to make some creative jumps across specific gaps!

## Controls:
Normal Controls: 
- _A and D/Left_ OR _Right Arrow Keys_: Move Left/Right
- _Space_: Jump
- _W/Up Arrow_: Start Summoning Blocks
- _R_: Restart Level (All progress in level will be lost!)

During Block Dropping:
- _A and D/Left_ OR _Right Arrow Keys_: Move Summoned Block Left/Right
- _Space_: Rotate
- _S/Down Arrow_: Fast Fall Block
- _W/Up Arrow_: Exits Summon Block Mode
- _B_: Destroy all Summoned Block and exits Summonn Block Mode

> Tip 1: If you are stuck, the R key restarts the level!

> Tip 2: If you are happy with the block formation you made, you should exit via Up arrow/W! If you fill up the area with too many blocks, they will all dissaper!
